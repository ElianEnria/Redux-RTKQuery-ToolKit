# Redux-RTKQuery-ToolKit

This project utilizes Redux-RTKQuery, a library based on the Redux pattern that simplifies API request handling in React applications. It leverages Redux Toolkit's capabilities to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for state management and API requests.

## Key Topics

- **Store**: Centralized data storage in Redux provides a single place to manage and update the application state.

- **Axios**: Axios is used as the HTTP client to make requests to the API.

- **RTK Query**: The RTK Query library from Redux Toolkit simplifies the definition and handling of API requests by providing a set of ready-to-use functions and hooks.

- **Redux Toolkit**: Redux Toolkit is a collection of utilities that streamline Redux usage by providing a more intuitive approach to defining actions, reducers, and the store.

- **Slices**: Slices in Redux Toolkit are a convenient way to define reducers and actions in a single place, making code organization and maintenance easier.

### Cache

One of the standout features of RTK Query is its ability to automatically manage API request caching. This means that the responses of requests are cached and can be reused when needed, improving the efficiency and performance of the application.

To verify cache savings in your application, make sure to follow best practices and properly configure the cache options provided by RTK Query.
